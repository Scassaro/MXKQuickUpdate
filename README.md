# MXKQuickUpdate
Python implementation of RTLAuto Binary Image Management

This program is meant to be a stepping stone to implementing all of RTLAuto's binary image management in Python and make it future-proof and mutable.

v0.2 supported platforms:

- MXK-F 219: 100% confirmed, works fine
- MXK-F Large Chassis: Got to work once. Needs further testing, but almost there.
- MXK Classic: Needs to be tested, but all code is there.
