# MXKQuickUpdate
Python implementation of RTLAuto Binary Image Management

Requirements:
- Python 3 (time, sys libraries): Needed for the interpreter to run the code.
- paramiko: Allows SSH between the involved devices.
- telnetlib: Allows Telnet between the involved devices.

This program is meant to be a stepping stone to implementing all of RTLAuto's binary image management in Python and make it future-proof and mutable.

v0.3 supported platforms:

- MXK-F 219: Works
- MXK-F Large Chassis: Got to work once. Needs further testing, but almost there.
- MXK Classic: Works.
